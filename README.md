The Flight Booking System is a Java-based software solution designed to simplify the process of booking flights for travelers. It provides a console-based interface for users to search for available flights, compare prices, and make reservations. The system utilizes the Java programming language, MySQL as the database management system, and Hibernate as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework.

## Database and ORM

The Flight Booking System utilizes a MySQL database to store information related to admins, customers, flights, bookings, and feedback. The database schema is designed with appropriate relationships and constraints, such as foreign keys and unique constraints. Hibernate is used as the ORM framework to map Java objects to database tables, providing seamless integration between the application and the database.
